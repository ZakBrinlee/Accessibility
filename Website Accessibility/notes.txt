NOTES:

Types of Disabilities:
  - Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders
  - Blindness or Low Vision
  - Brain Injuries
  - Deaf/Hard-of-hearing
  - Learning Disabilities
  - Physical Disabilities
  - Speech and Language Disabilities

Key takeaways:
  - All websites should be Perceivable, Operable, Understandable and Robust
  - Custom components are a big area that needs accessibility coverage. Making your own checkbox or button can negate the built it accessibile functionality that comes with HTML elements


WebAim Checklist:
  - Awesome checklist broken up by element/content type
    - https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist

SECTIONS:

  Keyboard Navigation:
    - Major sites have implemented keyboard shortcuts for quick actions (Twitter, Reddit etc - use shift+? to see)
    - Tab-able elements by default
      - <a>
      - <button>
      - <input>
      - <select>
      - <textarea>
      - <iframe>
    - Tabindex values
      - a negative value means the element is focusable but not reachable via keyboard Navigation
      - 0 (zero) means the element should be focusable and reachable with keyboard navigation.
      - a positive value means focusable and reachable with keyboard navigation. Relative order is defined by the value of the attribute. If elements share a same tabindex then it will go in order by position in the document
    - Skip Links
      - WebAim technique page: https://webaim.org/techniques/skipnav/
      - Checkout nytimes.com - They have an awesome 'Skip to navigation' and 'Skip to Site Index' links once you start tabbing on the page
      - Great way to allow users to skip to important parts of the content.
